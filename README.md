# MrBitSage's Command Mod

Adds needed items, blocks, ores, recipes, and logic to allow Command Blocks in survival mode. Should hopefully allow for some fun, yet not overpowered gameplay.

## Installation

Download the jar from the Jars folder and place it in the mods directory of both your server and client.

## Usage

Once the mod is loaded, it will generate command ore in the lowest levels of the world. It is extremely rare. In order to mine it, you must craft a Black Diamond Pickaxe with the following recipe:

D O D

_ P _

_ S _

D: Diamond
O: Obsidian
P: Diamond Pickaxe
S: Stick


Mined Command Ore will drop Command Dust which must be smelted into Command Gears.

Once you have enough Command Gears, the following recipe will produce a Command Block:

I G I

G R G

I G I

I: Iron Ingot
G: Command Gear
R: Redstone
